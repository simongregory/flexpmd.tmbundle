# TextMate FlexPMD Bundle

This bundle gives [TextMate](http://www.macromates.com) support for [FlexPMD](http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexpmd/FlexPMD/).

The bundle is currently experimental, as such it expects the following:

 * Source files to be in a saved TextMate project.
 * ActionScript and MXML source files to be in a directory named 'src'
 
## Installation

To install using [git](http://git-scm.com/):

		cd ~/"Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles/"
		git clone git://github.com/simongregory/flexpmd.tmbundle.git "FlexPMD.tmbundle"
		osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles'
		
Otherwise download the [zip][zip] or [tarball][tarball] and unpack it in `~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles`.

[zip]:http://github.com/simongregory/flexpmd.tmbundle/zipball/master
[tarball]:http://github.com/simongregory/flexpmd.tmbundle/tarball/master

Then select 'Bundles > Bundle Editor > Reload Bundles' from TextMate's menus		

Source can be viewed and forked via [GitHub](http://github.com/simongregory/flexpmd.tmbundle/tree/master)

## Configuration

By default the the FlexPMD report file will be created in the directory
`$TM_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/report/flexpmd/`. To override this set the env var 
`TM_FLEXPMD_REPORT` to your desired directory (it doesn't seem 
possible to change the name of the outputted file).

To specify a custom ruleset specify it's path using the env var `TM_FLEXPMD_RULESET`.
